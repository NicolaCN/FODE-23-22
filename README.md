### Global Dynamics of COVID-19: Trends, Patterns, and Implications

We aim to address three fundamental questions, the pursuit of answers to which justifies the construction of our end-to-end data pipeline.

1) How did COVID-19 spread globally, and which countries were most severely affected in terms of the number of cases and deaths ?
2) Is there a correlation between the COVID-19 situation, vaccination efforts, and the broader political response to the pandemic in various countries ?
3) What economic impacts did the COVID-19 pandemic have on different countries, with a specific focus on the cases of Italy and France ?
